# Exercise: editing the mock app directory

Take a look at the localhost mock `entries.json` and try your hand at tweaking it a bit.

This gets tedious quickly, a good reason to integrate with uPortal and manage this data in the database instead. :smile:

Hints:

* It's `mvn clean package && mvn jetty:run` to run `angularjs-portal` from the root of that project.
* Quotes within quotes in JSON need to be escaped effectively.
