# Exercise: add a theme

## Task 1: Try out existing themes

Try out live theme selection in `uw-frame` by running uw-frame if it's not yet running, by executing

```
$ npm run static
```

in the root of your uw frame.

and then navigating to 

http://localhost:3474/settings

There will be a theme selector pull-down at the lower left. Switch between themes to try different looks.

## Task: 2: Add a theme

Add a new theme, preferably for an institution you'd like to see adopt AngularJS-portal.

Hints:

* The `README.md` alongside this file. :)
* The theming documentation
* Many institutions have a Web or visual style guide specifying colors, providing logo images.

Solution available in `solution.md` alongside this file.
