Adjust an app directory entry represented included in the mock user layout to include a `list-of-links` widget.

You can model this after the "Manager Time and Approval" or "Course Services" examples.

Try it out for a variety of quantaties of links.

Hints:

* It's `mvn clean package && mvn jetty:run` to build and run `angularjs-portal`.
* You can use [the widget creator](https://public.test.my.wisc.edu/web/widget-creator) to prototype the widget
* [Font awesome has a directory of icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)
* `"widgetTemplate": null,` is fine when you're using a `"widgetType"`.
