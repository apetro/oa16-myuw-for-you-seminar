# Typed widgets

Content on the landing page is called "widgets".

Widgets can be interesting, personalized content rather than just a link to an app.

The easiest way to deliver an aesthetically pleasing widget is to use a supported `widgetType` and configure it with the data or URL to get data that the type expects.
